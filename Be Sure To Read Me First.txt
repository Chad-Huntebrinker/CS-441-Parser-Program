Before you type in any command in the racket program,
please make sure to open all the input files first.

When I was testing it, if you just typed in a command
without first oppening the file, like (parse "input1.txt"),
then an error comes up saying that file doesn't exist.

Not sure why it does that, but in order for the program to work,
open racket, then open the input files (you can close them afterwords
if you want), and then you can type in the command.

Thank you for your reading this and I hope you enjoy!
